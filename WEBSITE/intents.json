Use a general-purpose, slow-release fertilizer with equal or slightly higher proportions of nitrogen (N), phosphorus (P), and potassium (K), such as a 10-10-10 or 14-14-14 blend. Apply fertilizer when transplanting seedlings, and then again when the plants begin to set fruit. Avoid excessive nitrogen, as it can promote excessive foliage growth at the expense of fruit production. Consider side-dressing with compost or well-rotted manure as a source of organic nutrients."
